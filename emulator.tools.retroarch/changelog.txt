[B]Version 7.0.2-j06[/B]:
- bug fixes on the feature introduced previous release to forcefully use libs from [B][I]32bit Libs for RetroArch[/I][/B] addon. Thanks to mwnn and albundy @ freaktab for testing v7.0.2-j05.

[B]Version 7.0.2-j05[/B]:
- Now it also contains some linux libraries that were newer in libreElec 7.9+ so the compiled binary and cores can still run. Thanks to user dharry @ freaktab for identifying the required libs.
